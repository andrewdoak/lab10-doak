== DESCRIPTION:

RVM is the Ruby enVironment Manager (rvm).

It manages Ruby application environments and enables switching between them.

== Installation

  curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --autolibs=enabled [--ruby] [--rails] [--trace]

stable     :: Install stable RVM, good for servers.
--ruby     :: Additionally install latest ruby version (MRI).
--rails    :: Install gem rails into default gemset (also installs ruby=).
--trace    :: Print trace of the installation, gist output when you have problems.
--autolibs :: Enable or disable autolibs see: https://rvm.io/rvm/autolibs

More details here: https://rvm.io/rvm/install/

== Usage

  rvm [Flags] [Options] Action [Implementation[,Implementation[,...]]

== Flags

--default         :: with 'rvm use X', sets the default ruby for new shells to X.
--debug           :: Toggle debug mode on for very verbose output.
--disable-binary  :: Install from source instead of using binaries
--trace           :: Toggle trace mode on to see EVERYTHING rvm is doing.
--force           :: Force install, removes old install & source before install.
--summary         :: Used with rubydo to print out a summary of the commands run.
--latest          :: with gemset --dump skips version strings for latest gem.
--gems            :: with uninstall/remove removes gems with the interpreter.
--docs            :: with install, attempt to generate ri after installation.
--reconfigure     :: Force ./configure on install even if Makefile already exists.
--skip-gemsets    :: with install, skip the installation of default gemsets.
--quiet-curl      :: Makes curl silent when fetching data

== Options

-v|--version     :: Emit rvm version loaded for current shell
-l|--level       :: patch level to use with rvm use / install
   --bin         :: path for binaries to be placed (~/.rvm/bin/)
-S               :: Specify a script file to attempt to load and run (rubydo)
-e               :: Execute code from the command line.
--gems           :: Used to set the 'gems_flag', use with 'remove' to remove
                    gems
--archive        :: Used to set the 'archive_flag', use with 'remove' to remove
                    archive
--patch          :: With MRI Rubies you may specify one or more full paths to
                    patches

                    for multiple, specify comma separated:

                      --patch /.../.../a.patch[%prefix],/.../.../.../b.patch

                    'prefix' is an optional argument, which will be bypassed
                    to the '-p' argument of the 'patch' command. It is separated
                    from patch file name with '%' symbol.
-C|--configure   :: custom configure options. If you need to pass several
                    configure options then append them comma separated:

                      -C --...,--...,--...

--nice           :: process niceness (for slow computers, default 0)
--ree-options    :: Options passed directly to ree's './installer' on the
                    command line.
--with-rubies    :: Specifies a string for rvm to attempt to expand for set
                    operations.

== Action

(Note: for most actions, 'rvm help action-name' may provide more information.)

*usage*     :: show this usage information
version     :: show the rvm version installed in rvm_path
use         :: setup current shell to use a specific ruby version
reload      :: reload rvm source itself (useful after changing rvm source)
implode     :: (seppuku) removes the rvm installation completely.

               This means everything in $rvm_path (~/.rvm || /usr/local/rvm).

               This does not touch your profiles. However, this means that you
               must manually clean up your profiles and remove the lines which
               source RVM.
get         :: {head,stable} upgrades rvm to latest head or stable version.

               Check 'rvm help get' for more details.

               (If you experience bugs try this first with head version, then
               ask for help in #rvm on irc.freenode.net and hang around)
reset       :: remove current and stored default & system settings.

               (If you experience odd behavior try this second)
info        :: show the *current* environment information for current ruby
current     :: print the *current* ruby version and the name of any gemset
               being used.
debug       :: show info plus additional information for common issues

install     :: install one or many ruby versions

               See also: https://rvm.io/rubies/installing/
uninstall   :: uninstall one or many ruby versions, leaves their sources
remove      :: uninstall one or many ruby versions and remove their sources
reinstall   :: reinstall ruby and runs gem pristine on all gems,
               make sure to read output, use 'all' for all rubies.

migrate     :: Lets you migrate all gemsets from one ruby to another.
upgrade     :: Lets you upgrade from one version of a ruby to another, including
               migrating your gemsets semi-automatically.

wrapper     :: generates a set of wrapper executables for a given ruby with the
               specified ruby and gemset combination. Used under the hood for
               passenger support and the like.

cleanup     :: Lets you remove stale source folders / archives and other
               miscellaneous data associated with rvm.
repair      :: Lets you repair parts of your environment e.g. wrappers, env
               files and and similar files (e.g. general maintenance).
fix-permissions :: Repairs broken permissions (e.g. by sudo or chef)
osx-ssl-certs :: Helps update certificates for OpenSSL installed by rvm on OSX.
snapshot    :: Lets you backup / restore an rvm installation in a lightweight
               manner.

alias       :: Lets you set shortcut strings for convenience with 'rvm use'.
disk-usage  :: Tells you how much disk space rvm install is using.
tools       :: Provides general information about the ruby environment,
               primarily useful when scripting rvm.
docs        :: Tools to make installing ri and rdoc documentation easier.
rvmrc       :: Tools related to managing rvmrc trust and loading.
patchset    :: Tools related to managing ruby patchsets.

do          :: runs an arbitrary command against specified and/or all rubies
cron        :: Manages setup for using ruby in cron tasks.

gemset      :: gemsets: https://rvm.io/gemsets/

Bundler is installing for ruby but the dependency is only for x86-mingw32, x86-mswin32, x64-mingw32, java. To add those platforms to the bundle, run `bundle lock --add-platform x86-mingw32 x86-mswin32 x64-mingw32 java`.
