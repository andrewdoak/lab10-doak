Agile Development Depot Application


Chapter 6 - Iteration A -Initial Pretty Catalog Display

code> rails new depot

code> cd depot

depot> rails generate scaffold Product title:string description:text image_url:string price:decimal

note:text has modifying migration to add to price: t.decimal :price, precision: 8, scale: 2

depot> rake db:migrate

depot> rails server (use command specific to your environment e.g. rails s -b 0.0.0.0 for nitrous...)

view app preview at localhost:3000/products which will show products index page...

no data yet, and form shows limited space for the description
text suggests modifying the field specification for description in _form.html.erb template tohave 6 lines
<%= f.text_area :description, rows: 6 %>

Now add at least one product; example used is like:
Title: CoffeeScript
Description: <p>...javascript done right... </p>
Image_url: cs.jpg
Price: 36.00

when done adding, control+c to stop server

now, test:

depot> rake test

text discusses need for common test data; place in the ..depot/db/seeds.rb file
recommends downloading this file and also getting other asset files, like the images and loading
then install sample seed data

depot> rake db:seed

text goes on to additional 'prettify' or 'make pretty' steps
download and install css for products
verify that the application template file will accommodate this
change to alternate catalog display with a 'bespoke' page

experiments:

depot> rake db:rollback

-if successful will need to rerun migration and seeding to get back the database


git commands:

depot> git config --global --add user.name "your_git_username"
depot> git config --global --add user.email "your_git_email"

if you use --update you reconfig these local globals for github

view git config with

depot> git config --global --list

then, config a repository and commit

depot> git init
depot> git add .
depot> git commit -a "some labeling info"

return if you want using

depot> git checkout .
