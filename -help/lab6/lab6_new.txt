depot> rails generate scaffold Product title:string description:text image_url:string price:decimal

depot> rails generate controller Store index

   now, insert into the .../app/config/routes.rb file a new root route like:
   root 'store#index'
   comment out any other root records by putting the # tag before like
   #root 'products#index'
   check navigation in application.html.erb
	
   to list all products in the store index page, we need to set up data statement in Store controller index method.
   in the .../app/controllers/store_controller.rb file add
	@products = Product.order(:title)
   between the def index & end statements
   
   now, copy the product display statements we already have in the .../app/views/product/index.html.erb 
   insert these into the similar section of the (mostly blank) .../app/views/store/index.html.erb
    
download images and database seed file from within depot_a application in rails51 code archive

images copied into .../app/assets/images/
seeds.rb from rails51 archive overwrites file with same name in .../db/

apply rails helpers inside views:

strip_tags( )
sanitize( )
image_tag( )
number_to_currency( )
